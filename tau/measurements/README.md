# Pure tau flavour

The DELPHI bounds are too optimistic given that
> The limits on |U|^2 obtained from this analysis apply equally to all flavours of Neutral Heavy Lepton, ie equally to |Ue|^2, |Uμ|^2, and |Uτ|^2, except for the consequences of the additional kinematical suppression of the charged current decays in the case of a Neutral Heavy Tau Lepton, due to the large mass of the τ. 
> The main effect is to increase the decay length of such a lepton, leading to limits on |Uτ|^2 that are looser by a factor 1.5 for a mass of 3 GeV/c^2, rising rapidly to a factor 4 for masses of 2 GeV/c^2 or less, where the mean decay lengths corresponding to the |U^2| limits obtained are very long and the charged current decay is fully suppressed.
